Microservice Projects

Tickety (In-progress) - Ticket master clone using a microservice architecture. Next.js + Redux for Frontend, NATS for the event bus, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB and Redis for the backend

Blog - Microservice architecture for a blog. Implemented my own event bus to get a better idea how implementations like Nats work.
